This example demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications where an unhandled exception within an asynchronous callback function causes the entire server to crash.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version using error handling.  This is crucial for building robust and reliable Node.js applications that gracefully handle errors without unexpected termination.
